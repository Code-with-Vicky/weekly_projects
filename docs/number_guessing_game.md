## Title - Number Guessing Game

## Description

The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a specific range. The game provides feedback on each guess and keeps track of the number of attempts. The player has a maximum of five attempts to guess the correct number.

## Requirements

### 1. Game Initialization:

- The game should start by generating a random number between 1 and 100.

### 2. User Interaction:

- The user should be prompted to enter their guess.
- The user is allowed a maximum of five attempts to guess the correct number.

### 3. Feedback Mechanism:

- If the user’s guess is lower than the actual number, the game should display the message: "Too low".
- If the user’s guess is higher than the actual number, the game should display the message: "Too high".
- If the user’s guess is correct, the game should display a win message: "Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number."

### 4. Game Continuation:

- After the game ends (either by guessing the correct number or exhausting all attempts), the game should ask the user if they want to play again with the prompt: "Do you want to play again? Y / N".
- If the user inputs 'Y', a new game should start with a new random number.
- If the user inputs 'N', the game should terminate with a thank you message.

### 5. Error Handling:

- The game should handle invalid inputs gracefully, prompting the user to enter a valid number within the range or a valid response to the replay prompt.
